<h3>Buffer Pay Transparency Efforts</h3>

<b>Salary formula step 1</b>
We benchmark for position and experience level
The role benchmark is based on the software industry and the 50th percentile of San Francisco market data.

Role examples:

Customer Advocate III, $106,912

Product Marketer, $108,838

<b>Salary formula step 2</b>
Apply cost of living based on your location
These take into account being a global team, while closing the gap found in traditional compensation approaches.

Cost of living bands:

Global (90%) and High (100%)

<b>Salary formula step 3</b>
Determine a formula-based salary
We calculate salaries taking into account being a global team and closing the gap found in traditional pay practices.

Salary example:

A Product Marketer in an Intermediate cost of living band would earn $97,954.

<b>Our compensation philosophy</b>
We’re committed to providing fair and competitive compensation through these key principles:

Transparent
Openly share our approach and all salaries to create trust, hold ourselves accountable, and serve as a resource for the industry.

Simple
Maintain an easy-to-understand formula that allows anyone to easily see how we arrive at any individual salary.

Fair
Ensure that those with the same role and responsibilities who are at the same experience level are paid equitably.

Generous
Pay above market to attract the team we need, thrive as individuals, and avoid exceptions and inequity resulting from negotiation.

<b>The Buffer Salary calculator</b>
We built a salary calculator so that anyone can see what they would make at Buffer. We hope this information can also help others determine fair and competitive salaries across various roles and locations.

<b>Gender Pay Gap</b>
Our unadjusted pay gap at Buffer across the entire organization is .4% as of February 2022. We’re proud that this is much lower than average in tech (12%).
